# Tic-Tac-Toe
I have built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uploaded it to GitHub. This project features a simple, interactive UI, a responsive design, and a two-player mode. You can play the game by opening the `index.html` file in a browser. Future improvements include AI opponent, score tracking, and animations. Feel free to contribute and check it out on GitHub!
